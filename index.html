        <h2>Chorus</h2>
        <p>
            Drifting<br>
            Watchin' the world go round<br>
            World go, yeah (World go round)<br>
            Listening<br>
            To unfamiliar feelings and unknown sounds<br>
            Unknown sounds, unknown sounds<br>
        </p>
        <h2>Verse 1</h2>
        <p>
            Slippin' through my fingertips (Ayy), lingerin'<br>
            Shoulda, woulda, coulda, where'd I put the pen? (Woah)<br>
            Make a list of all my failed attempts<br>
            Runnin' outta space again<br>
            Highlight all the things I wish I never said (Stop)<br>
            If feeling makes you stronger, I'm the weakest<br>
            That would mean that I would have to separate from my beliefs<br>
            It's not a secret, I'm a puzzle, got a lotta missin' pieces<br>
            Underneath this strong persona, I put on's a kid that's screamin'<br>
            Aren't these waters so deceivin'? (So dеceivin')<br>
            They look differеnt, don't they?<br>
            Well, at least that's how they seem to me<br>
            'Cause we just drift and drift and drift<br>
            Until we see something that we define as peaceful<br>
            Grab the needle, shoot reminders in my veins<br>
            That people leave you while I'm driftin'<br>
        </p>
        <h2>Chorus</h2>
        <p>
            Watchin' the world go round<br>
            World go, yeah (World go round)<br>
            Listening<br>
            To unfamiliar feelings and unknown sounds<br>
            Unknown sounds, unknown sounds<br>
        </p>
        <h2>Verse 2</h2>
        <p>
            Lots of gossip, I've been watchin' you<br>
            How you're talkin' to yourself is rude<br>
            Driftin' I'm in the same boat as you<br>
            Sinkin', dreamin', screamin' for some truth<br>
            And (My, my) escalator's broke, I'll take the stairs, I guess<br>
            Climb until I'm outta breath<br>
            Questioning my every step (Woah)<br>
            My train of thought is leadin' me to different tracks<br>
            Positive that where I'm at is not where I should stay and that's (Why)<br>
            Told you look into the mirror and say, "I love you"<br>
            Convince yourself that no one in the world would ever want to<br>
            Passin' by the people that have been there to support you<br>
            From the get-go, disrespectful, drive you mental<br>
            Might get stressful when I'm driftin'<br>
            I see you in the distance<br>
            Askin' me why I'm so distant, I'm convicted<br>
            I'm convinced that I predict that all my wishes on my wish list won't be heard<br>
            'Cause I'm committed to the lie that feeling safe is unrealistic<br>
            When I'm driftin'<br>
        </p>
        <h2>Chorus</h2>
        <p>
            Watchin' the world go round<br>
            World go, yeah (World go round)<br>
            Listening<br>
            To unfamiliar feelings and unknown sounds<br>
            Unknown sounds, unknown sounds<br>
        </p>
        <h2>Outro</h2>
        <p>
            Ignorant to my ignorance<br>
            Tell me I'm worth it, God<br>
            Give me the faith to rise and help me diversify<br>
            To take a step forward, immersed in my belligerence, amplified<br>
            The feelings and words collide<br>
            Intensified by living a life deprived<br>
            I'd rather be burned alive<br>
            Than go back to thinkin' I'm insignificant (Insignificant)<br>
            Every impotent moment debated can trigger it<br>
            God is my witness definitive<br>
            Holdin' my head up, there isn't an innocent bone in my body<br>
            But that's what gives me the energy lacked<br>
            To renovate, have to innovate, past intimidates<br>
            Can't remain afraid<br>
        </p>
